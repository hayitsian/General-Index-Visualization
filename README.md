# General-Index-Visualization

Created by Ian Hay

A visualization project of the [General Index](https://archive.org/details/GeneralIndex), an aggregate dataset of hundreds of millions of publications by keyword. 

To mess with the visualizations, head over to `test.ipynb`. 

The testing data is located in the `data` directory, downloaded from: https://ia802307.us.archive.org/18/items/GeneralIndex/data/

To view current visualizations, you can open the `.html` graphs for interactive viewing in your browser, or open upon `.jpg` graphs for quick visualization.

Dependencies: python 3.8+, pandas, numpy, networkx, pyvis
